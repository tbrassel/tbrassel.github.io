### Overview
Experienced Data Engineer specializing in data-driven solutions and data analytics. Background in bioinformatics and healthcare data analysis, with proficiency in Excel, SQL, Snowflake, Python, and R. Committed to driving data-centric solutions for improved management and migration programs. Recent completion of Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate. 

In my role as a Healthcare Data Engineer at Colorado Community Managed Care Network, I administered databases remotely using Snowflake, MS-SQL, Salesforce, and Informatica. I utilized Python and R for ETL processes, managed data storage with Powershell scripts, and served as a Linux expert, provisioning a Kubernetes cluster for Apache Airflow job automation.

As a Bioinformatics Data Analyst at Genentech, I accelerated drug discovery by categorizing data through algorithmic sequence analysis. Developed parallelized data pipelines in R, Excel, and SQL, and contributed to the transition to a new central database. My internship at UC Davis involved enhancing single-cell genomic data integration and machine learning projects in Python and R, with collaborative efforts in deployment and documentation.

Looking forward to leveraging my skills for innovative projects. Let's connect!
