### Overview
In my previous role as a Bioinformatics Data Curator with Genentech, I played a key role in an international database upgrade and migration initiative that enhanced scientist productivity and secured intellectual property. As a Healthcare Database Engineer, I have successfully managed large datasets using Snowflake, Microsoft SQL Server, Salesforce, and Informatica Enterprise Cloud Data Management. I have scheduled Python and R scripts to process sensitive healthcare data, generating reports and data visualizations that drive effective decision-making. My skills in R, Python, and SQL would make me a valuable asset in meeting your organization's needs. I am excited to discuss how my expertise aligns with your mission and goals, and how I can contribute to your team's success.
