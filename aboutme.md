### Overview
I am a Data Analyst with experience working remotely with scientists, database developers, and business analysts to clean and convert Genentech's legacy databases to their new molecular information management system. I tracked, organized, and made decisions on data de-duplication and hierarchy management support tickets alongside Munich-based Oracle SQL developers to secure intellectual property and improve scientist productivity. You will like my experience constantly documenting my progress with PowerPoint presentations and LucidChart charts to project stakeholders, including R generated graphs and Excel tables to prove the scientific accuracy of all analyses I undertook. I am eager to apply my experience to meet your data analysis needs.
