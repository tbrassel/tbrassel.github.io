### Overview
As a Healthcare Database Engineer, I have successfully managed large datasets using Snowflake, Microsoft SQL Server, Salesforce, and Informatica Enterprise Cloud Data Management. In my previous role as a Data Curator at Genentech, I played a key role in an international database upgradeand migration initiative that enhanced scientist productivity and secured intellectual property. I have scheduled Python and R scripts to process sensitive healthcare data, generating reports and data visualizations that drive effective decision-making. My skills in data migration, SQL, and cloud-based data management tools make me a valuable asset in meeting your organization’s needs. I am excited to discuss how my expertise aligns with your mission and goals, and how I can contribute to your team’s success.
